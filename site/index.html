	<li>Learn something new</li>

<p>As Yaakov mentioned &quot; Entities are really helpful to avoid rendering problems. &lt; will be interpreted as <. &gt; will be interpreted as >. And &amp; will be interpreated as &. Also, when screen size is changed, it may split some words to accomodate them on the screen but using a non breakable space tag allows the words to not warp. The tag is "&nbsp;"&quot; This is where the quot ends.</p>

<aside>Aside tag is used when we need to put some information relating to the main content but is not actually the main content.</aside>

<footer>The footer tag is used to display the footer information about the page.</footer>
